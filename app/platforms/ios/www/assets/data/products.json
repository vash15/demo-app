The near-seamless, one-piece construction is woven more openly in areas where your foot and ankle need greater stretch and breathability, and tighter in areas that demand more strength and support.</p><p><b>Fluid Feel</b></p><p>The soft, contoured Lunarlon midsole has precision-lasered cuts on the sides that collapse during footstrike, delivering a perfectly smooth transition from heel to toe.</p><p><b>Superb Softness</b></p><p>The pressure-mapped outsole features Lunarlon pods in key areas to provide targeted cushioning.

Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability—all in one layer—was refined. The result is a featherweight, formfitting and virtually seamless upper.</div>",

In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional running shoe from the inside out.</div>",
